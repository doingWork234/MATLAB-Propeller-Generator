# MATLAB-Propeller-Generator
Automated MATLAB based propeller generator using OpenProp, producing watertight hub and blade geometry that is ready for CFD meshing and analysis. Tested in Ansys. 


This generates a surface mesh, not the required volumetric based mesh needed for CFD analysis which can be done through Ansys spaceclaim.
