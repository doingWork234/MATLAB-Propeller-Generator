# MATLAB-Propeller-Generator
Automated MATLAB based propeller generator using OpenProp, producing watertight hub and blade geometry that is ready for CFD meshing and analysis. Tested in Ansys. 


This script generates a surface mesh of the propeller, it does not generate a volumetric mesh which is needed for CFD analysis. However, volumetric meshing can be easily done through software such as Ansys Spaceclaim.
